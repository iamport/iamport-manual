## 2. Request one-time payment

To request a one-time payment, use the key-in REST API [POST /subscribe/payments/onetime](https://api.iamport.kr/#!/subscribe/onetime). The card information is not saved during this process.

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \   
     -X POST -d '{"merchant_uid":"order_id_8237352", "card_number":"1234-1234-1234-1234", "expiry":"2019-01", "birth":"123456", "amount":3000}' \
     https://api.iamport.kr/subscribe/payments/onetime
```

## 3. Request billing key + initial payment

To request a billing key and initial payment, use the key-in REST API [POST /subscribe/payments/onetime](https://api.iamport.kr/#!/subscribe/onetime) with the following parameter specified. PAYMENTWALL can not be used separately for requesting billing key without payment.


- `customer_uid` : Unique ID for the card (billing key)

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \   
     -X POST -d '{"customer_uid":"your-customer-unique-id", "merchant_uid":"order_id_8237352", "card_number":"1234-1234-1234-1234", "expiry":"2019-01", "birth":"123456", "amount":3000, "pwd_2digit":"00"}' \
     https://api.iamport.kr/subscribe/payments/onetime
```

## 4. Request payment with billing key

After successfully getting the billing key, the billing key is stored on the i'mport server using the specified `customer_uid` as the unique key. For security reasons, the server cannot directly access the billing key. Subsequent payments can be requested by calling the REST API([POST /subscribe/payments/again](https://api.iamport.kr/#!/subscribe/again)) with the `customer_uid` as follows:

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST -d '{"customer_uid":"your-customer-unique-id", "merchant_uid":"order_id_8237352", "amount":3000}' \
     https://api.iamport.kr/subscribe/payments/again
```
